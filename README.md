# Battleship
Battleship is my representation of the classical board game "Sea Battle" using the open-source RayLib Library.
It's my third small game project, where this time I used newly obtained skills such as:
- CMake
- GoF Patterns,
- Algorithms and Data Structures,
- and will be fully deployed into Git.

To Play the game you can simply open  MainExecutable.exe in : Battleship\install\bin\MainExecutable.exe
Or you can install on your computer using BattleShip-0.1.1-win64.exe
